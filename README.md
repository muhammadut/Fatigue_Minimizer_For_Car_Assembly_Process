# Minimizing Worker Fatigue through Optimized Job Assignments: A Practical Approach

# Description
An practical optimization framework for intelligently scheduling work rotations to minimize worker fatigue. This project utilizes combinatorial optimization techniques and fatigue modeling to optimize work rotations in industrial settings.

he primary objective of this project is to develop an optimized work rotation schedule that minimizes the overall fatigue within a work zone. I was project lead for this project at Honda of Canada Manufacturing.
It uses a fatigue function to model how fatigue accumulates over time and employs combinatorial optimization to find the best job assignments for each worker.


# Benefits
The implementation of this algorithm decreased injuries by 24% in 6 months post-implementation in the Honda Plant 1 in Alliston Ontario.

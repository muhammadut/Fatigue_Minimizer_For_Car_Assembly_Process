# Minimizing Worker Fatigue through Optimized Job Assignments: A Practical Approach
Description
An advanced optimization framework for intelligently scheduling work rotations to minimize worker fatigue. This project utilizes combinatorial optimization techniques and fatigue modeling to optimize work rotations in industrial settings.


Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to develop an optimized work rotation schedule that minimizes the overall fatigue within a work zone. 
It uses a fatigue function to model how fatigue accumulates over time and employs combinatorial optimization to find the best job assignments for each worker.
